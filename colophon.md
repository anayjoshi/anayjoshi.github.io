My name is Anaykumar Joshi, but for the sake of brevity, I go by Anay. I am an engineer by training and at heart and this blog is a dumping ground of all my broadcastable thoughts.

Most of my childhood was spent with numbers and I almost chose pure mathematics as a career; but a curiosity for understanding how radios and computers work made me pursue engineering. Eventually, I landed at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in) for my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. Post graduation, I worked towards electrifying rural India at <a href="http://www.grampower.com">Gram Power</a>. Presently, I am back at IIT Bombay as a Project Research Assistant in the Electrical Dept, working on **torsional vibration measurements**.

My interests have been volatile variables so far; but I guess I have stabilized enough on a few topics to write down here: As an Electrical Engineer, I have a fair deal of interest in `Renewable Energy` and in `Cyber Physical Systems`. As an undergrad, I played around with `Robotics` enough to become passionate for it. Recently, I have had a surge of interest in the art of writing `Safety Critical Software`. Right from my childhood, I have been especially interested in understanding how `Mathematics`, as a subject, evolved to its present majestic state. I believe every person should follow an art: I follow `Music`. I have never been a prolific writer, but I have just begun looking into the science behind `Content Generation & Presentation`.
