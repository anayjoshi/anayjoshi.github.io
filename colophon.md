My name is Anaykumar Joshi, but for the sake of brevity, I go by Anay. I am an engineer by training and this blog is a dumping ground for all my broadcastable thoughts.

Most of my childhood was spent with numbers and I almost chose pure mathematics as a career; but a curiosity for understanding how radios and computers work made me pursue engineering. Eventually, I landed at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in) for my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. Post graduation, I worked towards electrifying rural India at <a href="http://www.grampower.com">Gram Power</a>. I have recently joined [SEDEMAC](http://www.sedemac.com) in their Automotive R&D division.

My primary professional interests are in `Controls`, `Automotive Power-train` & in the art of writing `Safety Critical Software`. I am especially excited by practical application of `Mathematics` in `Mechatronics`. In addition to one's profession, I believe every person should follow an art: I follow `Music`.

## Website Theme

This website is hosted on [Github](http://github.com) using [Jekyll](). The theme is an slightly edited version of the beautiful [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) theme by [mdo](http://markdotto.com/). Some of the edits in the theme (such as the listing of the blog posts) were inspired from the theme of [nvie.com](http://nvie.com), while the circular avatar format was borrowed from [carlosbecker.com](http://carlosbecker.com)
