Hello all, meet Anay. I have recently completed my graduation and I am presently working towards electrifying rural India at <a href="http://www.grampower.com">Gram Power</a> 

# Education

Most of my childhood was spent with numbers and I almost chose pure mathematics as a career; 
but a curiosity for understanding how radios and computers work made me pursue engineering. Eventually, I ended up with a 
B.Tech in Electrical Engineering (with a Minor in Computer Science) at <a href="http://www.iitb.ac.in">IIT Bombay</a>

# Interests

This has been a volatile variable in my life; but I guess I have stabilized on a few subjects which I can write down here.
As an Electrical Engineer, I have a fair deal of interest in Renewable Energy and in Cyber Physical Systems. As an undergrad, I played around with Robotics enough to become passionate for it. Recently, I have had a surge of interest in the art of writing Safety Critical Software. Right from my childhood, I have been especially interested in understanding how Mathematics, as a subject, evolved to its present majestic state.
Finally, I believe every person should follow an art .. I follow music :)
