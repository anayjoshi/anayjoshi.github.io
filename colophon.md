Hello all, meet Anay. I have recently completed my graduation and I am presently working towards electrifying rural India at <a href="http://www.grampower.com">Gram Power</a> 

Most of my childhood was spent with numbers and I almost chose pure mathematics as a career; but a curiosity for understanding how radios and computers work made me pursue engineering. Eventually, I landed at [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in) for my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering.

My interests have been volatile variables so far; but I guess I have stabilized enough on a few topics to write down here. As an Electrical Engineer, I have a fair deal of interest in Renewable Energy and in Cyber Physical Systems. As an undergrad, I played around with Robotics enough to become passionate for it. Recently, I have had a surge of interest in the art of writing Safety Critical Software. Right from my childhood, I have been especially interested in understanding how Mathematics, as a subject, evolved to its present majestic state. I believe every person should follow an art: I follow music.
