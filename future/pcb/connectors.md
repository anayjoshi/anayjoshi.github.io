### JST Connector
JST connector is an incorrect vernacular term for small white electrical connectors on PCBs of small electronic products manufactured in Asia. JST is not a specific type or size of connector, but instead it's an acronym for Japan Solderless Terminal. To minimize confusion, it is best to describe a connector using: the manufacturers name, exact connector series, and optionally the pitch; such as "JST-XH" or "JST-XH-2.50mm" or "2.50mm JST XH-series" or other variations.
