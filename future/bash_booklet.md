# Bash Booklet

I have never been a fan of the syntax of bash and I keep forgetting it. I have never quite needed to heavily use shell scripting at work or play, but its a neat tool to have. This tutorial is a collection of the the relatively more commonly elements of **bash**. Why bash? I don't have any preference for any shell; but it seems bash is the most popular one out there.

Functions, variables, if-else, while, arithmetic, getting results of outside functions, environment variables, configuration (esp. git branch), PATH, comments, alias, which, user input, IO redirection, pipe, command line arguments, http://linuxconfig.org/bash-scripting-tutorial
