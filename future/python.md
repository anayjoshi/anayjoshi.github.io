Python
======

Why are we even mentioning Python in EERaga ? Isn't EERaga about electronics? In my limited experience with embedded systems, I have made Python one of the most important tool in my toolchain. Here some examples which motivated me to include Python in my toolchain

1. Communicating with a microcontroller over the serial port
2. Plotting some sensor data which has been collected from some sensor.
3. NumPy and SciPy are heavily used for scientific computation. In relevance to embedded systems, a knowledge of these libraries helps in designing embedded systems which implements algorithms in signal processing and control system.

My articles in Python would be focussed on embedded systems, but writing software in a language without quite understanding the language results in badly written, unmaintainable programs. We don't want to do that, do we? And hence, the articles here also generally speak of Python as a language.

A series of articles on Python

* simple magic methods: __eq__, __str__, __repr__, __hash__, __ne__
* *args, **kwargs
* list comprehension
* decorators
* iterators
* generators (memoization)
* context manager
* getters & setters (property)
* enumerate


* duck typing
* variable scope
* import structure (important while using mocking)
* when to use class methods
