Soldering
=========

Known brands: 
- Hakko (www.hakko.com)
- Weller (http://www.apexhandtools.com/weller/)
- Pace (http://www.paceworldwide.com/)
- Ersa (http://www.ersa.com/)

Roughly Rs 5000
Types of tips
- conical tip (uniform, not very useful). They don’t have mechanical area to transfer heat. (but do have one very thin tip of this type)
- chisel tip
- well tip (for SMD pins, wick it off)

## Flush side cutter

For cutting of solder legs (500) (flush means flat)
Roughly Rs 500


## Vacuum pump
Roughly Rs 150

## Magnifier
2.5x to 8x is enough

## Flux pen

## Solder wire
advice: use smallest possible diameter for solder wire (under 0.5 mmsq or 20 thou)

Composition of alloy of solder
Sn = Tin 
Pb = Lead
Ag = Silver

### Standard compositions of soldering wire
- 60 Sn / 40 Pb. Does not melt at a specific temperature (plastic region)
- 63 Sn / 37 Pb (more modern .. advisable). Melts at one specific temperature
- 62 Sn / 36 Pb / 2 Ag. Useful for soldering SMD components which have silver end caps (rarely used)


Use multicore solder wire (example: 0.46 sqmm, 5 core, 362 flux)

### Types of flux: 
- resin (rosen?) based flux (bad for environment)
- water soluble flux 

## Solder paste
you have to keep this in the fridge, warm it up before use






fumes == flux poisining
not washing hands == lead poisoning


180 deg C = melting
