summary: Introducing a new section on this website which lists interesting olympiad problems and their solutions
---

I spent the afternoon today revisiting some of the maths olympiad questions from my high school days: it was such an immensely satisfying experience! It seems my ability/inability to solve these problems has not changed much over the last 6 years; if at all, it has degraded a bit. I will try to shrug off the rust over the next few weeks. 

In the process, I am going to build a repository of questions of varied difficulty levels in the [Math Olympiad](/maths) section (also available on the sidebar menu). I would keep adding interesting problems (& solutions) as and when I come across them. The goal presently is to simply share the joy of solving non-conventional maths problems and stimulate some neurons in the process.

While some olympiad problems requires a genius mind and are out of reach of persons such as myself, most of the olympiad problems can be solved using *tools* which can be learned by training. A classic example, [Problem Solving Strategies](http://www.amazon.in/Problem-Solving-Strategies-Problem-Books-Mathematics/dp/0387982191) is an epic book for olympiad training. As far as possible, I will try to emphasize on the *generic* problem solving tools while discussing the solutions to these problems, so that new tools are added in our toolkit with every subsequent problem. Hopefully, this exercise would transmute into a useful resource for olympiad enthusiasts :)
