summary: Introducing a new section on this website which lists olympiad problems and solutions
---

Today was a good day. I revisited some of the maths olympiad questions from my high school days, and it was such an immensely satisfying experience. It seems my ability/inability to solve these problems has not changed much over the last 6 years; if at all, it has degraded a bit. I have gathered some rust and I will try to shake it off over the next few weeks. 

In the process, I am going to build a repository of questions of varied difficulty levels in the [Math Olympiad](/maths) section. I would keep adding interesting problems (& solutions) as and when I come across them. The goal presently is to simply share the joy of solving non-conventional maths problems and stimulate some neurons in the process.

Many of the olympiad problems (at least at the **Regional Maths Olympiad** & **Indian National Maths Olympiad** level) can be solved using specific *tools* which can be learned by training. A classic example, [Problem Solving Strategies](http://www.amazon.in/Problem-Solving-Strategies-Problem-Books-Mathematics/dp/0387982191) is an epic book for olympiad training. As far as possible, I will emphasize on the *generic* problem solving tools while discussing the solutions to the problems.
