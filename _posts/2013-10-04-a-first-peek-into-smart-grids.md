summary: On how I ended up joining Gram Power
---

It has been really long since I debuted with my first blog post a few months back. I had to post something today, just to give a sense of liveliness to the blog. Broadcasting my whereabouts would be a good idea I thought :)

It has been around a week since I joined [Gram Power](http://www.grampower.com), an **energy startup** born in U.C.Berkely, California. The company is mainly functional in the state of Rajasthan, with their office in Jaipur (where I am presently stationed). Gram Power is into building **smart meters** and setting up **micro grids** for villages which have no access to the utility power supply. For me, it has been a fun ride so far, tasting elements of a growing startup! Joining Gram Power was pretty much an impulsive decision. Up untill January 2013, I was all gunned up dreaming a PhD in computer science @ [IISc Bangalore](http://www.iisc.ernet.in); Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning was all that was in my head. In the months post January (my final semester at college), two things happened: I took up a course on *Advanced Machine Learning* and another one on *Power System Dynamics*. I hated the course on machine learning. Period. And somehow, despite not understanding a shit about power systems, I kept developing an interest in generating electricity (Swades?). The electrical engineer in me was waking up. Eventually, the build up exploded and here I am; working at Gram Power .. **generating electricity** :)
