Working at a startup has its pluses and minuses. What I considered a minus some weeks back, is something I have started to really enjoy off late! I refering to the art of **Multitasking**.

The world knows that working at startup requires every member of the startup to wear several hats. Well, I presently work at a startup; but unfortunately, I was never particularly great at handling more than one task simultaneously! Traditionally, my brain loved to put in focussed attention on a single task, and a *digression* into some other task is something that my cerebral half considered a crime! At [Gram Power](http://www.grampower.com), over time, my responsibilities gradually increased and my work *forced* me, in a way, to multitask. I was clearly out of my comfort zone.

A few days back, I saw a talk by [Harsha Bhogle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harsha_Bhogle), a fine cricket commentator. The talk was on *Achieving Excellence*, and of the several points which Harsha talked about, one struck a chord with me. He said that a **great** fielder, always wants the cricket ball to come to him, to prove (probably to himself) that he is a good fielder. That is attitude. Relating to that example, I have now started to try and **enjoy** multitasking! I now *want* to have multiple tasks to juggle with, just to prove (probably to myself), that I can multitask. I am still horrible at multitasking, that's not to debate! But I have at least started to enjoy something I loathed about.

I always thought *multitasking* is **black magic** which people are either born with, or without. Maybe that is true, but assuming that my *multitasking* skills have been decided at my birth, would be just an excuse to avoid even giving it a shot. Rather, I have started to think of multitasking as an **attitude**, an attitude to *achieve excellence*
