summary: Tourist. Camera. Click. Dump.

> I like travelling. Happily, in most of these tours, I have a bunch of family members to give me company. All of us carry our own cameras and all of us want to take back home memories of the supposedly beautiful present, to re-live the tour ... and hence, we **click**, a thousand times, with every single camera. Once the tour is done, we sit down to sort out the photographs and neatly compile them. I so love the experience of sorting the photos! **No**. 

Here is how we normally go about the photo clicking routine during a tour.

The step from `Filter Photos` to `Good Photos` is a laborious experience. Some *i-am-making-it-up-but-could-be-possible* hypothesis are in place: First, processing an overdose of photos strains the synaptic connections in the brain. Second, procastinating filtering of photos can literally break your synaptic connections. And third, the time spent in clicking excessive photos during the tour can be better put to use to simply enjoy the tour itself.

A few decades back, [Toyota](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota) introduced the concept of [Lean Manufacturing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing), which among other things, said **Minimize Waste**. A dozen other **Lean X** terms have since popped up ([Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) being a popular example). Now that everyone is applying *Lean* in front of every possible *X*, I thought I might chip in as well. In the context of clicking photographs, though the analogy might not fit in perfectly, I propose `Lean Photography`

Try this on your next tour, you might just enjoy your vacation a tiny bit more :)
