summary: Tourist. Camera. Click. Dump.
---

I like travelling as a tourist; I like it enough to make me move around with wide open eyes. Usually, and happily, I have a bunch of family members to give me some company in such tours. All of us carry our own cameras and all of us want to take back home memories of the supposedly beautiful present, to relive the tour etc. .. and hence, we **click**, a thousand times, with every single camera. Once the tour is done, we sit down to sort out the photographs and neatly compile them. I so love the experience of sorting the photos! **No**. 

Here is how we normally go about the photo clicking routine during a tour.

The step from `Filter Photos` to `Good Photos` is a laborious experience. Some points to observe here. First, an overdose of photos is injurious to health. Second, procastinating filtering of photos is worse for health. And third, the time spent in clicking excessive photos during the tour can be better put to use to simply enjoy the tour itself.

A few decades back, [Toyota](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota) introduced the concept of [Lean Manufacturing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing), which among other things, said **Minimize Waste**. A dozen other **Lean X** terms have since popped up ([Lean Startup](http://theleanstartup.com/) being a popular example). Now that everyone is applying *Lean* in front of every possible *X*, I thought I might chip in as well. In the context of clicking photographs, though the analogy might not fit in perfectly, I propose `Lean Photography`

Try this on your next tour, you might just enjoy your vacation a tiny bit more :)
