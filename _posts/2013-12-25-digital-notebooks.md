Back in IIT Bombay, I had taken up a course called **EDL: Electronics Design Laboratory** in my 6th semester. The course was on developing an electronics intensive product. The course had no lectures, no exams. The only deliverable was a product which worked at the end of the course! The instructor of the course gave us examples of [Faraday’s Diary](http://www.faradaysdiary.com/) on a number of occasions to motivate us to document all our ideas and experiments in a notebook. I liked the idea; tried to follow it; failed to do so.

I agree more than anyone else that documenting experiments and thoughts is a must, but I don’t believe paper notebooks are the best way to do so. Physical notebooks store data **sequentially**; paper notebooks are a good platform for simply writing down the day’s activity (it worked for Faraday!) but not best way of storing dynamic information. For example, paper notebooks won’t let me organise my understanding of, say *Capacitors*. As I get more information about *Capacitors*, I would like to go back to my *Capacitors notebook* and modify it. Papers notebooks miserably fail at allowing me to do so. To introduce this feature, I tried to maintain a file on a subject and use individual A4 sheets to write information. This gave me a consolation by allowing me to add A4 sheets somewhere in the middle of other sheets. But the fact remained: paper notebooks are simply not meant for storing dynamic information!

We are moving towards a paperless world and we have all the reason to do so. Digital notebooks bring about a **paradigm shift** in the way we store and think of information. They give us the flexibility of backing up notes, the flexibility of accessing notes on multiple devices, the flexibility of sharing information seamlessly, the flexibility of peacefully reorganising information, and a hell lot more.
Having failed at using physical notebooks as an effective way of storing information, I searched for digital alternatives. [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com), [Simplenote](http://www.simplenote.com), [nvAlt](http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/) seem to be some of the popular names. Even neatly organized plain text files should do a better job than paper!

Summary? Digital Notebooks are a great way of organising thoughts and information. Give it a shot :)
