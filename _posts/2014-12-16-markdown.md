summary: my mother tongue amongst Markup languages

I use [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) for formatting my emails, technical documentation, note keeping, writing this blog, and for everything in between. Its an absolute pleasure to use Markdown because of the amazing tools which good fellas have built around it. This post enlists the tools which have enriched my writing experience; you might just want to try them out!

## Pandoc

[Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) is a command line tool which helps convert files from one markup language to another. It is super powerful, though I typically use a small subset of pandoc's functionality: converting Markdown to Latex (and eventually to pdf). Pandoc has its own dilect of Markdown, (similar to [Multimarkdown](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)) which adds certain goodies such as tables etc. Give it a shot:

```console
pandoc hello.md -o hello.pdf
```

## Markdown Here

I find reading (long) emails a faily laborious task, mostly for the monotonicity of raw text. I exchange dozens of emails everyday at work; most of them being technical, and these mails often contain small code snippets. The plain text in the mails would have otherwise made my life very dull. Luckily, I stumbled upon [Markdown here](http://markdown-here.com/), a browser plugin which renders markdown formatted emails. Write in Markdown and bring a smile on your mail recipient's face!

## Sublime Text

I am a recent migrant from Vim to Sublime Text. Two plugins have made sure I stick along with Sublime Text for at least some time to come:

- [MarkdownEditing](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/MarkdownEditing): For beautifully formatted Markdown text
- [Table Editor](https://github.com/vkocubinsky/SublimeTableEditor): Nice shortcuts for creating tables, which otherwise are pain to build by hand

Plus, who needs [Byword](http://bywordapp.com/) when you have got Sublime? Here is a screenshot of some text written in Sublime Text with these two plugins and in distraction free mode.
