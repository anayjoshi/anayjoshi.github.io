As I write this post, I am sitting in front of **Matsya 2.0**, an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) on which I have been working for about one and a half years, as a part of the [AUV-IITB](http://www.auv-iitb.org) Team. It was a treat working with the team all this time! Here is an image of Matsya, swimming in the competition arena at [Robosub](http://www.auvsifoundation.org/foundation/competitions/robosub)

Prior to working on **Matsya 2.0**, we had developed **Matsya 1.0**. Shown below is Matsya 1.0 on the shores of the IIT Bombay swimming pool in early 2013

As a junior undergrad student at IIT Bombay, I had little respect for college level robotics; my perception of robotics was very narrow .. and (the monotonous) inter college technical competitions didn't help either. My picture of robotics was simple: some pulleys, levers, wheels and some bits and pieces of C programs running on some [Atmel](http://www.atmel.com) chips ([AVRs](http://www.atmel.com/products/microcontrollers/avr/) are bloody popular at IITB!). Then .. I grew up. There are several facets of robotics which I was not (and a lot more about which I am not yet) aware of .. varying from metallurgy and chemical engineering, to probabilistic mathematics and heavy duty control system engineering. This makes robotics so complete! One simply cannot complain about lack of interdisciplinary work while being involved in a robotics project. 
Personally, It has been a great experience working on Matsya. If you wish to read more about Matsya and the AUV-IITB Team, click [here](http://www.auv-iitb.org).
