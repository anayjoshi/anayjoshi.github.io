I am fascinated by internet routers. Every time I stare at them, I can't help but appreciate their *simple* user interface. A router probably is a classic example of **Black Box Products**. It simply needs to be plugged into the network, and with very little configuration, it becomes a gateway to the internet. That's incredible isn't it ?

If we compare products invented in different timelines, we get some interesting insights into the underlying infrastructures which defined products of their time. Yesterday's black boxes relied on **Physical sciences** to give them an underlying framework to work on top of. **Electromagnetism**, as an infrastructure, gave birth to several black box products: electric motors, radios being some of the examples. Many of today's black boxes build on top of on man-made infrastructures. **Internet** is a brilliant man-made infrastructure which provides a breeding ground for a plethora of products. A router is a black box given that the internet infrastructure exists. Similarily, a cell-phone is a black box provided the **telecom network** exists. Looking into the furure and drawing relevance with what I do in my job as of this writing; if tomorrow, smart grids become big enough to provide a powerful ecosystem, we might qualify smart meters as black boxes. 

A new technology is something special if it introduces the scope for new black boxes to emerge. A new technology is something special if it provides an infrastructure for a new era of black boxes!
