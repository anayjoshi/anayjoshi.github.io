It's been an year since I wrote here. This, is the comeback post - and I shall ([again?]()) write about the dearest topic to my mind. 

The way to think of incremental inventions is they prepare the mind. It provides a platform for attempting a leap towards the disruptive invention.

Incremental inventions provides immediate gratification

Theoretical physicists, mathematicians and the likes. And then we have engineers. 

The theorists don't (usually) care much about the actual realization

Three categories:

1. The Blue Sky Researchers - Einstein,
2. Experimental Researchers - Faraday, Galileo
3. Engineers - Tesla,

The Blue Sky Researchers are a funny lot. They are possibly the most celebrated, and possibly also the most frustrated. Personally, I cannot envisage being one of them - one needs a monk level disconnect & depth to be able to revolutanize the world. Run, peek into [Fermat's Last Theorem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUN4NDVIfVI) & the story of [Andrew Wiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiles%27s_proof_of_Fermat%27s_Last_Theorem). THAT, is classic blue sky research. Is it worth the effort? If the beauty of absolute theory tickles every tiny neuron of yours, then yes. Plus, your work might just be darn useful decades after you die.


Then comes the more manaegable and humanly Experimental Researchers - my favorites. The reason I like this category is the relative low entry barrier. One can start designing experiments 


The rockstar engineers build the Falcons. They use the existing theory. They know their shit. They don't deal with just prototypes. They bloody make the stuff work - robust, unbreakable and all such good words.
