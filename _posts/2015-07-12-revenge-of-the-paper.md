summary: A sequel to one of my earlier posts on Digital Notebooks
---

> It all started with my desire to store useful knowledge in a portable, future proof locker - so that an older version of myself could revisit this **knowledge repository** and avoid rediscovery. In the fag end of 2013, I was celebrating [Digital Notebooks](/blog/digital-notebooks) for all the claps it truely deserved. Today, in a *sequel* to that post, Paper Notebooks fight back. Would paper have the last laugh? 

For most of my engineering career until recently, I was developing software/firmware. When I was introduced to digital notekeeping on [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com) (and later [Simplenote](http://www.simplenote.com)), I had gone all nuts - happily jumping around my house. It was **perfectly** what I wanted back then for maintaining my notes.

Knowledge repositories for Software Engineering requires mainly text. Yup it does require visual aids - state machine diagrams, flowcharts etc., but these are standard visuals. Tools such as [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.com) can take in text and autogenerate these images. Piece of cake. So back when I was primarily writing code and using digital notebooks for building my knowledge repository, I was something like this

Then I got all excited about Electronics. As always, I badly wanted to document my assimilated knowledge before it evaporated (*Fun Fact - I have a terribly small memory buffer*). Digital Notebooks were just not helping me out this time round. I had to laboriously create circuits using [tablets and styluses](http://www.wacom.com). Creating images on digital tablets is either very difficult, or I have particularly poor motor skills. I can make crappy stick figures on these tablets ... but making circuits is a one day exercise. Plus, because of my fundamental [dislike for rich text](blog/markdown) format, I had to use Markdown and render images - which meant that I had to keep toggling between text and the rendered page; interrupting my thought flow and frustrating me big time. This just didn't seem the *right* way to build a knowledge repository! Essentially, I looked like this

Recently, with my new job, I kick started my career into industrial research. Now, there were shit loads of diagrams - all kinds of morphology. For a few days, I *very accurately* looked like this:

Allright that might be a slight exagerration, but you get the point. With all my love for digital notebooks, I just couldn't resist the temptation for the touch of a paper - that indescribable freedom which only a paper and pen can give. In early July, I cheated on the digital world - and bought myself these wonderful creation of mankind

The secret plan is to keep jotting down notes in these notebooks, and eventually scan them out as a backup.

**Here is the verdict**: The software fellow in me is still happy with digital notebooks; but a large part of me has now fallen for the classic paper notebooks. Do share your experience as well!
