**[RMO-1999]**: *Let ABCD be a square and M & N points on sides AB & BC respectively such that \\(\angle MDN = 45^o\\). If R is the mid point of MN, show that RP = RQ, where P & Q are the points of intersection of AC with the lines MD & ND*

**Solution**:

![Figure](/maths/figures/problem-3.png)

Join PN and MQ. Since \\(\angle PDN = \angle PCN\\), PDCN is a cyclic quadrilateral. It can now be inferred that \\(\angle PND = \angle PCD = 45^o\\).

Now look at \\(\triangle PDN. Since \angle PDN = \angle PND = 45^o, => \angle NPD = \angle NPM = 90^o\\). Similarly, \\(\angle MQD = \angle MQN = 90^o\\).

Since \\(\angle NPM = \angle MQN = 90^o\\), MPQN is also a cyclic quadrilateral. Furthermore, MN becomes the diameter of the circumcircle of MPQN since MN project \\(90^o\\) on the sector. Since R is the midpoint of MN, => R is the centre of the circumcircle of MPQN. Thus, RP = RQ
