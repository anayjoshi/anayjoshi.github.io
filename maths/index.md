[Problem #1](problem-1): **[RMO-1991]** *Prove that \\(n^4 + 4^n\\) is composite for all integer values of n greater than 1.* 

[Problem #2](problem-2): **[RMO-1992]** *Determine the set of integers n for which \\(n^2 + 19n + 92\\) is a perfect square*

[Problem #3](problem-3): **[RMO-1999]** *Let ABCD be a square and \\(M\\) & \\(N\\) points on sides \\(AB\\) & \\(BC\\) respectively such that \\(\angle MDN = 45^o\\). If \\(R\\) is the mid point of \\(MN\\), show that \\(RP = RQ\\), where \\(P\\) & \\(Q\\) are the points of intersection of \\(AC\\) with the lines \\(MD\\) & \\(ND\\)*

[Problem #4](problem-4): **[INMO-1995]** In an acute-angled traingle \\(ABC\\), \\(\angle A = 30^0\\), \\(H\\) is the orthocentre, and \\(M\\) is the midpoint of \\(BC\\). On the line \\(HM\\), take a point \\(T\\) such that \\(HM = MT\\). Show that \\(AT = 2BC\\).

[Problem #5](problem-5): **[INMO-1996]** Define a sequence \\(a_n\\) by \\(a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2\\), and \\(a_{n+2} = 2a_{n+1} - a_n + 2\\) for \\(n >= 1\\). Prove that for any \\(m\\), \\(a_m a_{m+1}\\) is also a term in the sequence.

[Problem #6](problem-6): **[Tournament of the Towns]** The sequence \\(a_n\\) is defined as follows: \\(a_0 = 9\\), \\(a_{n+1} = 3{a_n}^4 + 4{a_n}^3\\) for \\(n > 0\\). Show that \\(a_{10}\\) contains more than \\(1000\\) nines in decimal notation.
