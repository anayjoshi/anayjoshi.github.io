Smart grid task force .. Sam pitroda
Ok to 14 pilot projects. Laid down guidelines, and asked 14 distribution companies (discom) to execute the projects . Discom can be private franchise (tata, ambani power inmumbai). Gujurat itself has 5 discoms. Discoms are free to choose specs but bound by guidelines if they want money. Discoms in this case would be called implementing agency. Discoms would float a tender, which would also list qualification criteria for companies to bid for a tender.
Rapdrp (Restructured apdrp) .. Launched to reduce commercial losses, modernization (not necessarily smart)
Part a: hardware infrastructure
Part b: it, gis, scada
Rapdrp has panels which have big companies empanneled. Rapdrp is like a small brother to smart grid task force.
 
Private companies

Discoms can launch projects at the state level.
Private companies lobby, and try to influence consultants,  task force to modify guidelines.

RRECL 
The electrical transmission system is mainly carried out by central government body PGCIL(Power grid corporation of India limited).
To facilitate this process, India is divided into 5 regions : Northern, Southern, Eastern, Western and North eastern region. Further within every state we have a SLDC (state load dispatch centre).The distribution system is carried out by many distribution companies (DISCOMS) and SEBs (State electricity board.).
Types:There are two tariff systems, one for the consumer which they pay to the DISCOMS and the other one is for the DISCOMS which they pay to the generating stations.
Consumer pricing: Total cost of electrical energy = fixed cost +semi fixed cost + variable cost = (a + b*KW +c*KWh ). KW represents maximum demand
It is mandatory for the consumer to maintain a power factor of 0.8 or above otherwise penalty is levied on them depending on the deviation. 
Discom pricing: regulated by CERC (central electricity regulatory commission). This tariff system is called Availability based tariff (ABT).
This tariff mechanism also has of 3 parts: Fixed charge + capacity charge + UI (Unscheduled interchange). 
Mechanism of ABT

    The Generating stations commit a day ahead about the schedule power which they can provide to the regional load dispatch centre (RLDC).
    The RLDC conveys this information to various SLDC which in turn collects the information from various state DISCOMS about the load demand from various types of consumers.
    The SLDC sends load demand to RLDC. And now RLDC allocates the power accordingly to the various states.
    If every things goes well, power demand is equal to power supplied and the system is stable and frequency is 50 Hz. But practically this rarely happens. One or more state overdraws or one or more GS under supplies. This led to deviation in frequency and system stability  
    UI charges are incentive provided or penalties imposed on the generating stations. If the frequency is less than 50 Hz, implies demand is more than supply, then the GS which supplies more power to the system than committed is given incentives. On the other hand, if frequency is above 50Hz, implying supply is more than demand, incentives are provided to GS for backing up the generating power. Hence it tries to maintains the system stable

Methods of power factor improvement

    Capacitors: Improving power factor means reducing the phase difference between voltage and current. Since majority of loads are of inductive nature, they require some amount of reactive power for them to function. This reactive power is provided by the capacitor or bank of capacitors installed parallel to the load. They act as a source of local reactive power and thus less reactive power flows through the line. Basically they reduces the phase difference between the voltage and current.
    Synchronous Condenser: They are 3 phase synchronous motor with no load attached to its shaft. The synchronous motor has the characteristics of operating under any power factor leading, lagging or unity depending upon the excitation. For inductive loads, synchronous condenser is connected towards load side and is overexcited. This makes it behave like a capacitor. It draws the lagging current from the supply or supplies the reactive power.
    Phase Advancer: This is an ac exciter mainly used to improve pf of induction motor. They are mounted on shaft of the motor and is connected in the rotor circuit of the motor. It improves the power factor by providing the exciting ampere turns to produce required flux at slip frequency. Further if ampere turns are increased, it can be made to operate at leading power factor.
