suction pile (sunction embedded anchor). The pipes are hollow (open in bottom, closed on top). when they reach sea bed, they go down a bit, but beyond that point, air is pumped out till a certain point and when the pile gets deeper, we stop pulling out air. An ROV is actually responsible for actuating the suction of air. Apparently the ROV first attaches the pump to the suction pile (also called anchor pile). Sunction pile has markings written on it and while deployment, cameras on the ROV (?) help to see the buried depth

### KG Basin

* Considered the largest basin for natural gas in India
* KG-D6 (Krishna Godavari Dhirubhai 6) - Reliance (not producing much). Officially called KG-DWN-98/1
* KG-DWN-98/2 - ONGC
* S1 and Vashishtha deep water developments
* 1986, hyper alpha disaster

## General
on shore range is about 300 m
percussion drilling is effective on land, not in water
pile hammer is used for percussion drilling in shallow water
exploratory drilling rig is first setup before the production drilling rig
while drilling, esp in exploratory oil rig, the drills can be bent to resemble the root of a tree spanning of the order of 20 ams

## Largest oil rig (Perdido)

* 3 km
* Shell
* Gulf of Mexico
* Spar (cylinder like thing. It apparently forms the base of the deepwater oil rig) I guess the spar is a floating structure which is connected (anchored) using the suction anchors.
* ballast hose is used. Water is filled on the base so that the spar (which is like a can) can be upright in water
* For handling circular currents which can sway the spar, the spar uses a 'strake' which is a thin structure around the spar which interferes with the circular currents
* the topside then sits on top of the spar.
* once the topside is placed on the spar, the centre of gravity is on top, which makes the system very unstable. Molten steel is filled on the base of the spar using a separate ship

Classes of ROV:
1. Workclass ROV
2. Intermediate class ROV
3. Observation class ROV


Tether Management System handles lengthening and shortening the length of the tether.
ROVs probably have vector thrusters

Historical events where ROVs were used
1. RMS Titanic
2. Bismark
3. USS Yorktown
4. SS Central America
