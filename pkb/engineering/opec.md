Crude oil: hydro carbons + impurities (oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, heavy metals)

Petroleum: latin petra (rock) + oleum (oil). It means the same as crude oil.

3 conditions for oil accumulation:
1. source (dead org) should be deep enough so that core's heat can cook them
2. Porous rock (often sandstone) should be nearby. Porous rock should have good permeability
3. Cap rock to trap the oil.
4. 

3 layer cake is formed: water -> oil -> gas

Term: bitumen


Properties of oil
* API gravity (American Petroleum Institute)
* sulphur content - higher => more corrosive effect on equipment
* nitrogen content
* carbon residue
* distillation range
