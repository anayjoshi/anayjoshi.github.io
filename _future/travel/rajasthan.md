# Rajasthan

This post attempts to log my travel experience in Rajasthan. In the process, I would try to keep this post educating enough for the reader to take something back home. Back in school, I had a rigid aversion towards history. This pleasantly changed during my first tour in Rajasthan (mostly Marwar) in August 2013. In late Jan 2015, I got another oppurtunity to tour the remainder of Rajasthan (mostly Mewar), and I have thoroughly rejoiced these two tours.

Probably the best way to study history, is to visit historically significant places, and then connect the blocks.
