Frequency Compensation

Typically used in amplifiers which have negative feedback. Goals of frequency compensation
- To avoid unintentional creation of positive feedback (which would cause the amplifier to oscillate)
- To control overshoot and ringing in the amplifier step response

Methods of implementing frequency compensation
- Dominant pole compensation (is a type of lag compensation). The lowest frequency pole is called the dominant pole because it dominates the effect of all other poles. Often the implementation of dominant pole compensation results in pole splitting
- Lead compensation: this places a zero in the open loop response to cancel out the effect of one of the poles
- Lead-Lag compensation: places both a zero and a pole, with the pole being placed at an open loop gain of less than 1
- Feed forward compensation

1 Transmission Unit = 1/10 bel =  1 decibel

One example of why transfer function adds value to engineering.
Consider LTI system and try to plot the gain of a sinusoidal input for all possible frequencies.

advantage of knowing how to plot bode plots by hand?
- understand how poles and zeroes affect transfer function
- estimate transfer function by looking at frequency response
