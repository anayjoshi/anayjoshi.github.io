Operational Amplifier
=====================

gain bandwidth product (-3db bandwidth at unit gain)
bandwidth improvement by cascading opamps .

bwn = bw*sqrt((2**1/n) - 1)

opamp offset voltage measurement:

1934: Harry Black conceived the idea of negative feedback
Eventually it was realised that high gain amplifiers suffer from stability problems
1945: Bode came up with a graphical method of analysing stability of feedback systems
mid 1960s, Fairchild released uA709, the first successful opamp IC; major drawback of this IC was stability and it required external compensation
uA741 was a successor to uA709; it was internally compensated.
