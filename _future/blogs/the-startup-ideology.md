One of the Indian politicians was recently ridiculed for saying that *Poverty is a state of mind*, and I fear being ridiculed for saying a similar phrase; but I hope I make sense, when I say **Startup is a state of mind**.

As [Peter Theil]() so beautifully puts it in his book [Zero to One](), when he writes
> A startup is a conspiracy to change the world.
