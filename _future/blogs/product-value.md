# Engineering Products

Here is a theory. Every product has some inherent **value** in it. You can maybe visualize the product as a water tank with a tap. You turn the tap on, and with the passage of time, the water tank drips water.

Multiple products may have the same value content in them. But these products may have different time characteristics for extracting this inherent value. 

**Category 1**: I think most products fall into this category. These are products whose value is returned in a very short amount of time. From a consumer's perspective, an example would be something like amusement park ride, chocolates, books.

**Category 2**: Products such as a car, mobile phone, laptop. As long as the these products performs the way the consumer expects them to perform, they keep generating value for the consumer.

**Category 3**: smart meters, most data products. 


x axis: time, y axis: value generated by the product
classify various products into these categories
if the engineering skillset in the compony is not too great, go for products which fit the right curve. The engineer's goal should be able to trust himself into building products which generate value latter in their lives.
