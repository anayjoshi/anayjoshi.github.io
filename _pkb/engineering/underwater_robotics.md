cockpit voice recorder  (CVR) + flight data recorder (FDR) + underwater locator beacon (ULB) = black box
ULB is powered by lithium battery which is sufficient for 30 days of pinging underwater
Frequency range ~ lower 
10s of kHz
Range at which it is detectable ~ < 20km

Honeywell makes such black boxes

sea water does not allow good EM wave propagation

The modem developed by the Sea-Eye team allows a data transmission rate of up to 150kbits/sec on carrier frequency between 300KHz and 1MHz, rates which are much more robust than is available elsewhere. Plans to market modems in the near future with transmission ranges of up to 300-500 meters
