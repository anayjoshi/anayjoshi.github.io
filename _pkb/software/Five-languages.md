I recently came across a couple of videos where [Larry Wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR8fQiskYII) (Creator of Perl) [Bjarne Stroustrup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvWTnIoQZj4) (Creator of C++) talk about 5 programming languages one should know. That encouraged me to write down my list of languages This post is about my selection of 5 languages

Here is my selection:

## Python

Python is my default language. It is undoubtedly the most intuitive language I have come across. It falls just short of Haskell when it comes to sheer beauty; but it comes damn close. Plus, the community around Python is mind blowing.


## Haskell

Haskell is a mountain I so desperately wan't to climb. Not many use Haskell, not many have even heard of Haskell. I had serious doubts on my computer science knowledge when I first met Haskell. When the time comes when I could write idiomatic Haskell, I would have achieved *Moksha*. 


## Ada

For someone who is interested in developing Safety Critical Software, **Ada** is the ultimate language. When it comes to safety and security, look no further than Ada. I initially thought that Ada was a fairly outdated language.


## C

Most of my peers in the embedded systems community are comfortable with C. That is the **only** reason why I had to add this language in my list. For me, **C** is just one tiny abstraction on top of barebones assembly. The software engineer in me dislikes this language, but hey, its damn popular.

##JavaScript

I respect JavaScript for the fantastic ecosystem of the tools around it. I am a deliberate outsider when it comes to web development. But I did some web stuff while at work a few months back. I don't love this language, but I do respect it.
