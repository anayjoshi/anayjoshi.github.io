delta U = Q - W

Carnot Cycle
- At constant temperature, PV curve would follow a hyperbola

Adiabatic condition: P.V^gamma = K, where gamma = Cp/Cv

PV = nRT
W = Q1 - Q2
what is work done during adiabatic process?

Q1 = nRT1 ln(Vb/Va)

Vc/Vd = Vb/Va
efficiency = 1 - T2/T1

Proof on ratio of volumes:
U = 3/2. nRT
