MC34063: a very generic DC DC converter IC. MC is the old code for Motorola, but this IC is now made by several vendors. Btw, ON Semi is the new name for Motorola. Available in DIP-8 and also in SOIC-8

Configurable as a buck or boost converter. Costs just 50 cents. Also allows us to convert 4V input into -12V output => a total of 3 configurations


Say specs are:

Input: 5V, +-10%
Output: 15V, 100mA (100mV ripple)

A common diode to use is B220A

Higher the frequency, lower the efficiency, lower the value of inductor (=> smaller the size of inductor)
