isotropic (uniformity) antenna
considered a perfect antenna
radiates in all direction (point antenna)

3dB: doubling in power
10dB: 10x in power
6dB: doubling in range (in isotropic case. in directional antennas, range might get more than doubled or less than doubled)

0dB: original power

ratio(bels) = log10 (P1/P2)

FSPL (free space path loss) = (4pi*d*f/c)^2 (applies to isotroptic antenna)
FSPL = Pt*Gt*Gr/Pr
this is a unitless quantity
Gr depends on frequency of receiving antenna hence the frequency dependency in the antenna
term: antenna gain

dBm: dB relatice to 1 mW. example: 20dBm = 100mW
dBi

doubts:
*energy
*what are p1 & p2 in context of antenna?
*where does current flow in antenna?
