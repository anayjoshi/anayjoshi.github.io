EMI: Electromagnetic Interference - a problem
EMC: Electromagnetic Compatibility
RFI: Radio Frequency Interference (an old term)
SI: Signal Integrity

SI deals with milivolts and miliamps, whereas EMC deals with micro at emission levels, and kilo at immunity level

PQ: Power Quality - deals with surges, sags, transients, outages etc

? conducted vs radiated emissions
? what is braid (context: braid or foil)

a capacitor can become an inductor at high frequency (because of track length). Ground impedance can change at high frequency


source-path-receptor mode

Higher the frequency, more likely it is that the coupling path is radiated. Lower the frequency, more likely it is that the coupling path is conducted
