Zionism is the concept of jeweist nationalism. Most zionists were secular jews.

It turned out that during WW1, Britain had promised palestine to Zionists, Meccans and to themselves. By 1939, Jews were 30% of palestine. The arabs in palestine started a revolt against British but British suppressed it. Then Britain asked for a joint country to be formed (jews + arabs).

Post WW2, Britain handed over the issue of palestine over to UN.
Palestine was divided into two lands for Jews and Arabs, but the boundaries were like a jigsaw puzzle. Israel got some more of the land post the war (1949). There was again a war in 1969 and Israel occupied even more land
