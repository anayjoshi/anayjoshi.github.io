# TAX

## Hotels and Restaurents

VAT, abatement, service tax, service charge

- In a restaurant, service tax is ONLY applied on the service charge (and not on the total bill)

## VAT

5%, 12.5%

TIN number: TAX-Payer Identification Number. It is a 11 digit number. First 2 digits are code for the state. This number is mentioned in all VAT transactions.

## Gift Tax

- If total gift (money) received in an year crosses 50,000 then that amount gets included in your income and is taxable
- Gift from blood relative is not taxable
- Marriage gifts are not taxable


## Restaurant tax

Say total sum of food bill is 1000. Beverage bill is 1000
VAT on food and beverage is different (eg. 5% and 15% reap)
=> VAT = 50 + 150 = 200
Service charge is decided by the restaurant. There are no govt. regulations on it. It ranges from 5% to 10%. Say service charge is 10%
=> sub total bill = 2000 + 200 = 2200
If service charge is levied, don't pay tip
Service tax is applied on sub total bill (food + beverage + service charge)
Service charge is 12.36% of 40% of sub total bill = 4.94% of sub total bill

hence, total bill would be 2000 + 200 + 200 + 108.68 = 2508.68
Restaurant must be air conditioned for service tax



## Invoice

Say A rendered a service of 1000 to B
Say service tax rate is 12.36% and TDS rate is 10%
A would charge B a total of 1123.6 Rs.
B would pay A 1123.6 - 112.36 Rs
